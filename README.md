# Upscaled-Player-Textures-GI
Compilation of upscaled textures for characters of a certain anime game.


Textures upscaled using AI, these NOT ready for use and some need extra work like Lisa's around her thighs, if you wanna use this textures you must first save them as .DDS and add the alpha if that texture has alpha, either as BC7 Linear for Lightmaps or BC7 sRGB for Diffuse.
Alphas are bundled in a separate folder so you don't have to use alpha mask to remove it, alphas are upscaled as well.

Will upscale textures for mods that have custom textures as Hakezer's Mona and Raiden, Cybertron's Succubus Raiden or Silent's LongHaired Sucrose, for these upscales a drop-in replacement .DDS will be provided so just replace the original texture in your mod folder.

These are the results that can be expected from this upscaled textures
