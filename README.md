# Upscaled-Player-Textures-GI
Compilation of upscaled textures for characters of a certain anime game.

-Added upscale based on PS5's textures which are 2K in resolution all thanks to Sultana@Festivity's Datamining Server, you can find the sorted textures in Zeroruka's Github here https://github.com/zeroruka/GI-Assets.

Disclaimer not all textures are available just a few and most PS5 Textures need a vertical flip before being used

-As more PS5 textures are released I'll continue to upscale those as the upscaled PC Textures lose their value.

Added upscales of the textures shared by yarik0chka@Festivity's Datamining Server

TL;DR: PS5 textures by themselves are better than my shitty upscale, use those as they become available, upscaling PS5's textures yields little gains compared to PC textures but are useful if you either want those for your mods and/or play at 4K or higher with 1.5 render scale.

Textures upscaled using AI, these are NOT ready for use and some need extra work like Lisa's around her thighs, if you wanna use this textures you must first save them as .DDS and add the alpha if that texture has alpha, either as BC7 Linear for Lightmaps or BC7 sRGB for Diffuse.
Alphas are bundled in a separate folder so you don't have to use alpha mask to remove it, alphas are upscaled as well.

Will upscale textures for mods that have custom textures as Hakezer's Mona and Raiden, Cybertron's Succubus Raiden or Silent's LongHaired Sucrose, for these upscales a drop-in replacement .DDS will be provided so just replace the original texture in your mod folder.

These are the results that can be expected from upscaling the original PC textures
