# Upscaled-Player-Textures-GI
Compilation of upscaled textures for characters of a certain anime game.


Textures upscaled using AI NOT ready for use, if you wanna use this textures you must first save them as .DDS either as BC7 Linear for Lightmaps for BC7 sRGB for Diffuse, Alphas are bundled in a separate folder so you don't have to use alpha mask to remove it, alphas are upscaled as well.

Will upscale textures for mods that have custom textures as Hakezer's Mona and Raiden, Cybertron's Succubus Raiden or Silent's LongHaired Sucrose, for these upscales a drop-in replacement .DDS will be provided.
